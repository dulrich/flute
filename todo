(Todo|Wish)list:

[ ] indent level
[ ] highlight all instances of selected text
[ ] "smart" home key (toggles between start of line and end of whitespace)
[ ] click regex -- arbitrary length list, ex: [a-zA-z0-9]+ [\w-]+ .+\n *
	alternate: \b\S\b ^.+$ *
[ ] line #s
[ ] find/replace -- plain text | regex
[ ] delete line, clear line
[ ] syntax highlighting
	- configurable word/boundary matching (hypen,underscore,etc may be word \
	or symbol characters depending on language)
	- brace matching -- support complex brace/tags <?php ?> <xml></xml> {{ }}
[ ] block comment C-d -- language-specific (un)comment selected line/section
[X] open buffer stack -- track order of previously viewed buffers. can be \
	traversed manually, or automatically if current buffer is closed
[ ] mark changed buffer
	- visual marking wherever buffer/filename is shown (file tree, title bar)
[ ] destructors / delete objs -- currently memory is leaked by everything
[ ] persist list of open buffers
	- rebuild tree on load with previously open buffers
	- lazy loading after restart

*** where possible, features should be configurable in a config file, or an \
	interface which mirrors the file
*** according to unix philosophy a program should focus on doing one thing \
	well. for a programming editor that would be programming. other functions \
	such as window, file, and project management should be left to tools \
	built for those specific purposes. in an ideal world major chunks such as \
	syntax highlighting and find/replace would be broken out
