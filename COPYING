====================
Originally based on Fl_Text_Editor
====================

	A simple example of Fl_Text_Editor

	Fl_Text_Editor is unlike other FLTK widgets in that
	to work correctly, it must be assigned to an instance of an
	Fl_Text_Buffer.  The below shows using buffer() to connect
	the two classes together.

	Note that the example can also be used to demonstrate
	Fl_Text_Display; just replace all instances of
	Fl_Text_Editor with Fl_Text_Display and rebuild.
